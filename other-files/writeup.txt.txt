1. I had to make several corrections about contrast between background and text and alternative text for images. The current 48 errors
are just links that are empty. We have not added them in the assignment yet. The one alert is from redundant alternative image text.
It's for the profile picture, I think because the username is in multiple places. But it is not similar to any other things like 
the stories panel, which were done through the for loop.

2. I think if everyone does their share, then I think most all are solvable. If every user takes a second or two to provide their
alternative text to their image, it will make the process a lot easier as many things can be automated too. Like the suggestions panel
can be configured to support alt text from within the code.

3. It is definitely usable if you turn off CSS, however it most definitely will not be accessible or aesthetic. CSS covers much of the
color contrast, and users might not be able to tell what refers to what since everything will not be organized.

4. It is usable but maybe not as enjoyable. Provided that I have given alternative text, it is usable since that can replace the images
to a certain extent.
